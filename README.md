# Circuit Implementation and Analysis of a Quantum Walk-Based Algorithm
In this repository we provide a modified version of the SKW algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210064) to perform the search complement of a marked node in a $2^n$-dimensional complete graph with self-loops, by decreasing the probability of the quantum state associated to the marked node.
