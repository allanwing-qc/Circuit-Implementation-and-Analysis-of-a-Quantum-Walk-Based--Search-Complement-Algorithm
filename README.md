# Circuit Implementation and Analysis of a Quantum Walk-Based Algorithm
In this repository we provide a modified version of the SKW algorithm (https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210064) to perform the search of a marked node in a $2^n$-dimensional complete graph with self-loops, by increasing the probability of the quantum state associated to the marked node. Additionally, we provide a second modification to the SKW algorithm to obtain what we call the $search\; complement$, i.e. in this case we decrease the probability of obtaining the quantum state associated to a marked node of the graph.
